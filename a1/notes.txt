reflection

pros
 + Fun memes for the images.
 + on click events arent as hellish
 + playing nethack in your browser is cool
cons
 - using someone elses css is less fun.
 - The syntax for a lot of things are way differnet to what im used to
 - animate.css is convenient, but there arent amy cool animations for my first image
 - NodeJS is a pain if the package you are trying to build has minimal documentation on dependencies, installing them manually did not work, but using yarn did?
